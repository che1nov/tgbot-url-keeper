# Telegram URL Keeper Bot

**Telegram URL Keeper Bot** is a simple Telegram bot written in Go using the [Telebot v3](https://github.com/tucnak/telebot) library. The bot allows users to save, view, and delete URLs. It implements the following features:

- **Saving URLs:**  
  Users can send a URL in the chat, and the bot will check its validity. If the URL is valid, it gets saved.

- **Viewing saved URLs:**  
  By pressing the "üìÇ My Links" button, the bot sends a list of previously saved URLs.

- **Deleting a URL:**  
  By pressing the "üóëÔ∏è Delete Link" button, the bot asks the user for the ID of the URL to delete and removes the selected URL.

- **Help:**  
  The "‚ùì Help" button displays instructions on how to use the bot.

- **Start:**  
  The `/start` command or pressing the "üöÄ Start" button displays a welcome message with a description of the bot's functionality.
